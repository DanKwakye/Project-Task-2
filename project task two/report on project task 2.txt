Trial Stores 77 and 88:

 Both stores experienced statistically significant increases in total sales and customer traffic during the trial period compared to their control stores. This suggests a positive impact from the implemented changes.

Trial Store 86: Unlike stores 77 and 88, trial store 86 did not exhibit a statistically significant uplift in sales or customer traffic. 

Further investigation with the client is recommended to determine any potential implementation variations specific to store 86 that might have influenced the results.


Overall Trial Performance:

Despite the outlier case of store 86, the trial program demonstrates a promising overall impact. The significant increases in sales and customer traffic observed in stores 77 and 88 suggest the implemented changes have a positive effect on key performance indicators.
